# frontend_js_API

Frontend app for a auction website, designed to be used with the corresponding backend API, also on this profile. 
Use npm install, then npm run dev to run the app. It should launch on localhost 8080, the backend does need to be running on port 4941.
Both the frontend and backend rely on a mysql databse containing auction and user data. This data can be reset and resampled with a 
post request to /reset, /resample. Read into the routes file for each app if unsure.
